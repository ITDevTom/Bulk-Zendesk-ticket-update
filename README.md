# ZenDesk_Ticket_Update

This script will ask for 5 tickets ID's, the update and then will post that update to the tickets
If you dont want to update 5 tickets then just press enter when asked for the ID's

You will need to add your username, password and your organsations url to the request. 

Any questions let me know
